## The Definition of Risk
Risk according to ISO31000 is defined as, **"Effects of uncertainty on objectives"**. In other words, risk is an event that might happen which affects our objectives. Risk does not exist in vacuum; **it is related to the objectives we are trying to achive**. Every fields has their own defintion of risk. Likewise, experts have their own definition of risk as well. 

**Definitions of risk in other fields**
- Risk in Finance : "Volatility of return."
- Risk in Security : "Any event that could result in the compromise of organizational assets."
- Risk in Engineering : "The likelihood of variation in the occurrence of an event, which may have either positive or negative consequences.

**Related concepts**
- Probability : A quantitative measure of likelihood of an event that is often used to measure risk.
- Threats : An event where a party inflicts harm on purpose.
- Hazard : An inherent danger of an object.
